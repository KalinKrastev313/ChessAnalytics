Chess Engine Setup
Free open source version of the Stockfish chess engine can be downloaded from:
https://stockfishchess.org/download/
After the archive is unzipped, in ChessAnalytics/settings the full path to
the exe file should be added in ENGINE_DIRECTORIES dictionary('r' before the directory string).
When using the engine for testing purposes, it is advisable to fill the form with
depth less than 10, in order to keep the calculation time under 2 seconds.

PGN Display
The lichess analysis board https://lichess.org/analysis would display string with the moves only.
Currently this is the requested pgn format. My website would not be able to parse multiple line PGN, or
extended PGN with additional info for players e.t.c. Once a game is correctly saved, matplotlib is used
to display evaluations (shown only in reasonable range(-3, 3))

Test Strings
In testing_data there are some non-random FEN and PGN strings for testing purposes.
