The project aims to provide tools for personal analysis of chess positions and games.
The application can read positions from FEN format, store them in a DB and provide top engine lines
at a given depth. Theoretical positions can be distinguished from puzzles.
Games in PGN format can also be examined. Score for each move can be displayed in a easy to read matplotlib plot.
Additional features such as user control and sharing comments are available. 


Chess Engine Setup
Free open source version of the Stockfish chess engine can be downloaded from:
https://stockfishchess.org/download/
After the archive is unzipped, in ChessAnalytics/settings the full path to
the exe file should be added in ENGINE_DIRECTORIES dictionary('r' before the directory string).
When using the engine for testing purposes, it is advisable to fill the form with
depth less than 10, in order to keep the calculation time under 2 seconds.

PGN Display
The lichess analysis board https://lichess.org/analysis would display string with the moves only.
Currently this is the requested pgn format. My website would not be able to parse multiple line PGN, or
extended PGN with additional info for players e.t.c. Once a game is correctly saved, matplotlib is used
to display evaluations (shown only in reasonable range(-3, 3))

Test Strings
In testing_data there are some non-random FEN and PGN strings for testing purposes.


Choose the style of your pieces
The logged in users can choose preferences for chess piece style. In case you would like to customize
your own, you just need to create new folder in static/pieces/ and add there image for each piece,
following this naming pattern: f"{piece_type}-{piece-color}.png". The folder would be automatically
recognized by the form for chess piece style preference.
